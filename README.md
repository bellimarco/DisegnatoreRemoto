# LAM Robotica

![](Records/Main.JPG)

A plotter I built for my end-of-highschool project "LAM" in robotics and programming. It is based on a polar setup with two stepper motors for radius and angle, and a servo controlling the pen/pencil pressure. The actuators are controlled by an esp8266/arduino combination, which connects to a local server created on a computer using NodeJS. There is also an interactive client interface which communicates with the server, where the user can easily create plot files in a variety of ways and monitor live the plotting process. For more information I refer to the [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/YZUVihPjlJg), the [LAM document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNYdujj7nw69idaycSoJI1g8GDug3v7r/view?usp=share_link), the [presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fd8GVBbd57P3TvLT5uVGksJDZHUYSeOo/view?usp=share_link), or more generally to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wct3qKXmZ5XBtKPVcveJ319wTMBxPO_R?usp=share_link) where more records like images and videos can be found.
