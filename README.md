# LAM Robotica

![](LAM/Records/foto%20componenti/Main.JPG)

A plotter I built for my end-of-highschool project "LAM" in robotics and programming. It is based on a polar setup with two stepper motors for radius and angle, and a servo controlling the pen/pencil pressure. The actuators are controlled by an esp8266/arduino combination, which connects to a local server created on a computer using NodeJS. There is also an interactive client interface which communicates with the server, where the user can easily create plot files in a variety of ways and monitor live the plotting process. For more information I refer to the [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/YZUVihPjlJg), the [LAM document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yufAzvm-YmBF5FJW-CDQHOr3H1Efvr5cywDJvZXltzI/edit?usp=sharing), the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ybNW9f366qOdg-vAGhiV8jnD6vP20Fr81bRC0PI2Oig/edit?usp=sharing), or more generally to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wct3qKXmZ5XBtKPVcveJ319wTMBxPO_R?usp=share_link) where more records like images and videos can be found.
