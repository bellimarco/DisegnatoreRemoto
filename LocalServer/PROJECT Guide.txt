For Convention, Order and Clarity in the code throughout the whole project:


EVERY "workstation" page includes theese files(included by the html):
  "Mode".html           core
  "Mode".css
  "Mode"Mode.js
  -eventually other .js files-

  globalvariables.js    JScripts
  letter.js
  phrasesettings.js
  navsettings.js
  focuscanvas.js
  MJCanvas.js
  MainCanvas.js

  p5.js                 libraries
  p5.dom.min.js
  jquery-3.4.1.min.js

  CommonStyle.css       css style
  CanvasPageStyle.css
  NavStyle.css
  GalleryStyle.css


the only things that change through every "workstation" page are:
  the html layout and content elements in the html
  the code for the software that gets put in the Mode.js file

HTML
remember that if something is meant to be in the nav,
it must be put in .nav-content divs in the right navigation,
where the things related only to the specific page are present

if an element in the navigation is interactable,
you must put it in the class .nav-active,
because by default the navs are pointer-events:none.

CSS
the css affecting the specific page must all be put in the file "Mode".css,
because all the other files are common.
the css must only affect elements added by the specific page.

JAVASCRIPT
the canvas file is created as: var MainCanvas = new p5((p)=>\{code\},"body-div")
see the MainCanvas.js file for more info

The code of the specific page is written in the Mode.js file
try not to use global variables,
the JScripts folder only contains common javascript files, so if you have to add
a file specific to the page(another canvas, a set of functions) create it
in the folder of the "workstation" page.



SERVER
for now the server only has one main JS code file(and other resources folders).
The local server (on my iMac) is created through the terminal
